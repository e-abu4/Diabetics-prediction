Pregnancies: The dataset includes a wide range of pregnancy counts, with values ranging from 0 to 10.

Glucose: Glucose levels in the dataset vary, with values ranging from 78 to 197.

BloodPressure: There are instances where blood pressure values are zero, which may require further investigation or data cleaning.

SkinThickness: Some entries have a skin thickness of zero, which might need scrutiny, as this seems unusual.

Insulin: There's significant variability in insulin levels, with values ranging from 0 to 543. Zero values may need to be interpreted carefully.

BMI (Body Mass Index): BMI values in the dataset cover a wide range, with values ranging from 23.3 to 43.1.

DiabetesPedigreeFunction: The diabetes pedigree function values are relatively small and have limited variability.

Age: The dataset contains a range of ages, with values from 21 to 53.

Outcome (Target Variable): The dataset is labeled with outcomes indicating the presence (1) or absence (0) of diabetes.

*As we all know that glucose is the most determining factor in the diagonsis of diabetics.In the dataset provided we analysis various variables and their the glucose level to acertain if there is any relationship
*The relationship betewen Body mass index(BMI) shows ther is relatively weak positive correlation . A correlation coeffient of 0.22 suggest a positive relationship betwen the two variable but its not very strong.
*The correlation coefficient of the realytionship between age and glucose is 0.26 which shows a mild positive linear relationship between the varaible
*The relationship between pregnancies anf glucose is 0.13 which shows postive linear relationship but its weak

65.1% OF patient do not have diabetes while 35.9% are diabetic
The logistic repression model acheived an accuracy level of 75%, indicating a decent performance in predicting diabeticsbased on the proviede dataset.However as with other model there is always room for improvement

Recommendation
From the analysis i will recommend constant checkup for patient as we can see that age, pregnancies, BMI,Bloodpressure and other variable can slightly increase ones glucose level.
